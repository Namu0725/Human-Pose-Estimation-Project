# Human-Pose-Estimation-Project

This repository contains the implementation of a Human Pose Estimation system that detects and predicts the key points of a human body (e.g., joints like elbows, knees, shoulders, etc.) from images or videos. 
This project aims to build an efficient pose estimation system using advanced machine learning techniques and pre-trained models, enabling applications like fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction.

Features:
1. Key Point Detection: Identifies and tracks key body joints accurately.
2. Real-Time Processing: Processes video streams or live camera feeds efficiently.
3. Visualization: Provides intuitive visual overlays for detected key points and pose skeletons.
4. Applications: Usable for applications like activity recognition, sports analysis, animation, and rehabilitation
